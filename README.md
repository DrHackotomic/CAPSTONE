We will develop a website that provides real-time data on food available at the Cornell Campus Center (CC), and students who have already been to the CC will be able to fill it out. Our site will also have the option of giving feedback on the food specifically how it was in terms of taste and what could be added. Also, in the event that an item runs out and gets replaced with something else, students can also indicate if that food item is no longer on the website. This website wonâ€™t replace the current CC menu website but can be used as an extension/plugin by the actual menu website.
