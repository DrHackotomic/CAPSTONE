# Topic
____________
We will develop a website that provides real-time data on food available at the Cornell Campus Center (CC), and students who have already been to the CC will be able to fill it out. Our site will also have the option of giving feedback on the food specifically how it was in terms of taste and what could be added. Also, in the event that an item runs out and gets replaced with something else, students can also indicate if that food item is no longer on the website. This website won’t replace the current CC menu website but can be used as an extension/plugin by the actual menu website.

# Motivation
____________
Our motivation for selecting this as our project was to prevent students from traveling to the CC from a far distance and students needing clarification on what food was being served at the CC during the designated meal times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The motivation for this website is also based on the personal experiences of us Rollins students going to the CC and not finding anything appealing enough to eat based on our dietary preferences or allergies. We also want the online presence of the CC’s menu to be more accurate and readable. The availability of websites related to the Rollins campus is essential to provide students with up-to-date information.
