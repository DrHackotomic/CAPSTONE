        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p> We are a group of senior Computer Science majors who want to make a difference in accessing the menu for the CC. We want to improve the accuracy of the menu so other students who frequently use the CC will be able to know what food is and isn't available. </p>

            <h2>OUR MOTIVATION</h2>
            <p> Our motivation for selecting this as our project was to prevent students from traveling to the CC from a far distance and students needing clarification on what food was being served at the CC during the designated meal times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The motivation for this website is also based on the personal experiences of us Rollins students going to the CC and not finding anything appealing enough to eat based on our dietary preferences or allergies. We also want the online presence of the CCâ€™s menu to be more accurate and readable. The availability of websites related to the Rollins campus is essential to provide students with up-to-date information. </p>

            <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
            <p> This system will serve to provide more accurate and real-time data regarding the food available at the Cornell Campus Center. It will provide a better description and indication of what is available to help the students with allergies better select foods to eat. Some students also have about 5 swipes per week. Since swipes are non-refundable, our website can provide info about what is available to them before they physically come to the CC and potentially waste a swipe. Some students also live very far from the CC for example in the Sutton apartments or Holt. This website will serve to help minimize the amount of walking done by students. </p>
